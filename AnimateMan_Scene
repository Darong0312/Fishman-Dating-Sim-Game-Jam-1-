I finally returned back to my all too familiar apartment, or at least I think it is. With all this alternate universe hopping it's kind of hard to tell. Everything of mine seems to be in place, like the (insert extremely specific object) on the couch to the (insert another extremely specific object) in my room, so I think it's to safe to say that I am home.

(IF choosing no one is an option: Coming back here alone like this after meeting all my lively interdimensional neighbors, I am suddenly reminded of just how empty it is. The soul crushing loneliness. The lack of a tender touch. GOD I want someone to hold me. It's a good thing I have something special for times just like this.)

(IF failed to get a date: Home feels so hopelessly empty now after facing that complete rejection. My soul? shattered. My dreams? crushed. My mental health? Cripplingly depressed. There is only one way to drown my sorrow.)

I go to my room and boot up my good ol' PC and click open an application. The title reads on screen "My Love romance <3." Upon starting the game and loading up an old save file, I am greeted by a handsome anime boy.

"Hey (Goldfish)! What a coincidence meeting you out here. Do you live around this area too? We could walk to school together! Oh, only if you want to of course."

My first crush, (insert generic? japanese name), oh how I've missed you. (IF failed to get a date: I'm so sorry I ever tried leaving you, I hope you'll take me back.) You were always the only one that understood me. I will go anywhere if its with you. 

I held hands with my digital boyfriend as we walked to school together. It was such a lewd act before marriage that it had me swooning. 3D people could never match the amount of excitement I feel in this moment. As long as as I had (insert name), all was right with the world.

<i>When you blink again, the apartment looks a little different. The bloody scarf is still on the table, but there are some interesting new touches to the room around you. You sift through a pile of clothes that aren’t yours, picking up a shirt that looks like it’s around the size of your own clothes. The pants seem to be your size too. Before you can take a closer look, a sudden voice startles you.</i>

"Hey you!" Octavia says.# CLASS: Octopus

You verse jump back towards Octavia's apartment where you find her penning away at her desk intently with a stack of envelopes piled up, seeminlgy oblivious to your presence.

As you take a step, she whips around and gives you a menancing stare which sends chills throughout your body before instantly returning back to her calm demeanor before.

"Gilbert, what brings you back here? I thought I told you that you don't need to return those clothes to me."

You take a moment to let your heartrate return to normal before saying,

"Well I have something I wanted to ask you."

"Oh? Whatever did you want to ask?"

"Would you wanna go out on a date with me sometime, maybe?", you ask tentatively while curling up your hands behinf your back. 

After what feels like forever, Octavia replies

<i>Making your choice, you take hold of the fencing sword. You find yourself in an apartment that is just like yours, but not. You notice that there’s a poster of Swordlington, a famous fencer. Though in your own universe he’s a Crab, not a Carp. As you take in your surroundings, you hear a crash and see a young swordfish man on the floor of the kitchen, surrounded by pots and pans. He notices you, and stands up immediately, dusting himself off. <i>
“Uh… hi.” # CLASS: SwordFish
<i>He says, obviously he wasn’t prepared to have a guest over. Or an intruder you guess.<i> 

“Hi. Are you good?” <i>You ask, gesturing vaguely to the pots and pans on the floor.<i>

<i>He looks to the pans, then to you, then back at the pans, then back at you, <i>“They’re not alive, they can’t hear you.” # CLASS: SwordFish

<i>Oh god he’s stupid.<i>

    <i>Spencer looks at the sword and his face lights up</i>, “I thought I lost that!” <i>he runs up to you and you hand it over. He starts practicing stances right in front of you.

        “How long have you been fencing?” <i>You ask.</i>

        <i>He shrugs,</i> "About 5 years now." # CLASS: SwordFish

    Spencer beams, and begins to flex. It’s a little funny considering he’s wearing a knitted sweater with pink hearts all over it. “Yeah, been working on my technique, too. Guess you could say that I’m one of the best on my team, but it’s no biggie.”

        <i>Spencer looks a little sheepish at first, then puffs out his chest with pride,
            "I'm the best in my team! I love the competition." <i>He replies. # CLASS: SwordFish
        He continues to gush for a while about his love of fencing, and his choice of fencing style. He actually sounds a little smart when he talks about it!</i>
       <i> After you show interest, he shows you a couple of moves, (and his muscles hehe) and the two of you spar with a mop and broom. He totally let you win, even though you can tell it's still nice. There was no way that you fully knocked the mop out of his hand. The two of you laugh about it.</i>
        "You're a lot more fun to hang out with than Octavia, she's kinda weird." <i>He says suddenly.# CLASS: SwordFish
        <i>That came from nowhere,</i> "What do you mean?"

        <i>Spencer shrugs,</i> "I'm not sure. She's nice and all just she doesn't like the sport or competition of fencing... I think that she just likes stabbing..." <i>then he smiles,</i> "But she's really cool, I swear. She knits and sometimes her sweaters pop up here.

        You blink, "Octopus girl?" <i>you ask.<i>
        <i>Spencer nods,<i> "Yeah, though she doesn't like the competition or the sport of it. She just likes knives and stuff. Kinda creepy but she's chill." # CLASS: SwordFish
        "Neat..." <i>you're not sure how to respond. Knives are scary. Or maybe... a little hot?<i>

    "Oh yeah!" <i>He picks up the super-buff figurine of a cartoon Bass. He's got hair with big spikes in the front that defy reality.

And also how kick-bass he is, and how he's super duper powerful and never loses a fight. But he's also a good guy." # CLASS: SwordFish
    <i>You nod. Not worrying about the spoilers you know and what happens to that character.<i>
    
    "But that guy, Bently doesn't get it. He likes the guy with rock powers because he says that he's more 'morally complex' or whatever. When have superheroes ever needed to be morally complex?

You nod, remembering Bentley’s rather dramatic take on action anime, “I hear he doesn’t really appreciate a good guy as much.” you say.

        <i>Spencer looks like he's about to cry, his whole worldview invalidated. You can't help but feel like you've kicked a puppy because he's staring at you with huge, sad eyes.

    "Um... yeah?"
    <i>Spencer goes to pick them up,</i> "I went to a soup kitchen to volunteer earlier.

    “WOAH yeaH! Are you psychic??” He asks, staring at you with wonder.

    You laugh, “No, just met Jasmine.”

    He beams at you, “Oh she’s really cool! We went to a soup kitchen to volunteer earlier.

    “Yeah, but Jasmine told me not to give them to GoodGill because they exploit their workers and don’t pay them a liveable wage.” he shrugs, “But the soup kitchen doesn’t have anywhere to keep this many pots and pans so…” he gestures to the cast-iron chaos around him.

    <i>He nods vigerously</i>, "Jasmine helps me out sometimes when I spill stuff. She also explains things to me, like <i>an- are- key.</i>."

    "You know, you should talk to Jasmine, I didn't understand things about The Man, or about <i>olie-garkie-cal oh-pres-ors</i> but once she taught me about how the world works I wanted to be a superhero too." <i>He shrugs,</i> "Maybe, if you gave a fuck, you could be one too!" # CLASS: SwordFish

    "I... Uh... Sorry." he grumbles as you help him up. # CLASS: SwordFish

You verse jump back towards Spencer's apartment where you find him practicing his fencing before once again crashing into some conveniently placed pots and pans.

He looks up at you, completely unfazed by the fact you saw his little fumble and says with a beaming smile, "Gill, you're back! Did you want to practice some fencing with me?" # CLASS: Swordfish

You pause for moment, thinking of how to answer his question but also how to ask him your own.

"Yeah, I do but before I do, I have something I wanted to ask you."

"Oh really? I hope it isn't a hard question but I'll try my best, buddy!" 

"Would you wanna go out on a date with me sometime, maybe?", you ask tentatively while curling up your hands behind your back. 

After what feels like forever, Spencer replies:

"Oh really? I hope it isn't a hard question but I'll try my best, buddy!" 

"Would you wanna go out on a date with me sometime, maybe?", you ask tentatively while curling up your hands behind your back.

“Of course! I’m so glad you asked, I was going to ask you the same question, actually!” He says, then starts to laugh, “That wasn’t really a hard question after all!” Spencer takes up a broom, and tosses you a mop in one smooth motion, (or at least smooth for him) and grins, “Winner gets to choose the date!”

This time, he gives you a more fair fight, and the two of you actually go on for a while. Eventually he does beat you, but as soon as he pokes you with the makeshift weapon, he takes your hand and twirls you. You blink, confused, before he pipes up.

“I don’t really care where we go as long as we get to go together, so what do you wanna do?” he asks.

- sword_aff < 1:
His expression turns from one of interest to disappointment. “Honestly, I think I’d rather just be friends. I just don’t really feel the same, you know? I feel like we just don’t know each other that well enough yet.”

Your eyes gaze down in thought, processing his response. He’s not wrong, most of his interests are still a mystery to you.
“Yeah, I guess you’re right. Sorry for throwing that on you so suddenly.”

“All good,” he smiles, returning to what he was working on. “I'll see you around.”

You turn back towards where you came, wondering how to process the rejection

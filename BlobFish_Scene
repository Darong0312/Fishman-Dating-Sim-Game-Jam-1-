<i>Taking hold of the controller, you close your eyes to blink and when you reopen them you find the walls apartment space filled with posters of various animes, video games, movies, and cartoons you know about but all of them appear to have the characters swapped opposite from what you know them as regularly except the Herring Otter Series posters.  But what really catches your attention is the absolutely savory smell wafting from the kitchen area of. </i>

<i>You follow the mouth-watering, heavenly scent you notice that this apartment's living area is a little more messier than yours with loads of memorabilia blankets and pillows of various characters in interesting clothing except for the table area which has a rather sizable TV, a laptop with glowing keys, and a few high end game consoles on it. Right next to it looms a giant clear case with what looks like little peop-?</i>

<i>You hear some loud popping and sizzling from the kitchen before you take a whiff an- wait *sniff* is tha- *sniff sniff* Oh, it's ramen *snif sniff sniifff* with the fried tempura vegetables!?  *sniff* AND THE SPICY HOTSAUCE!!</i>

<i>You burst into the kitchen where you find a young blobfish dude just a tad shorter than you, sprinkling some spices into pot from which the blessed aroma is originating from while faintly humming the opening song of 'My Eel Roe Acarpdemia'. Despite your rather sudden entrance, he doesn't notice you until you are basically drooling right next to him.</i>

"BwaAAAHH!" <i>he screams, while yanking out some earpods from his ears and jumping back from you.</i> # CLASS: Blobfish

"Who are you? Are you an intruder? Have you come to kill me? You can take my life but you will never take away my spirit or any of my limited edition memorabilia!" <i>he rapidly fires off while taking on a what you assume is some sort of fighting stance.</i> # CLASS: Blobfish

"N-no, I'm Gilbert your... neighbor I think" <i>you say while wiping the drool off of yourself and scatching your head.</i>

"Oh, okay then..." <i>the blobfish says as he drops his guard very slowly. Once he finishes, he looks at you and then slightly bows before saying </i>"I am Bentley. It's nice to meet you!"  # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>You pause for a second before bowing back, and once you do, Bentley goes back to stirring the pot like nothing happened.</i>

<i>Bentley looks over at you, and tilts his head as he asks</i> "Oh you're still here, what's up?" # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>Bentley laughs before smugly smiling, </i>"No, I am far from those who would relegate food to just a financial experience upon which nutrients are exchanged. I am among those who choose to enlighten the masses and spread the doctrine that food is more than what we treat it as." # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>Bentley steps away from the pot before striking a pose with one fist in the air </i>"Food is love! The love we show our own bodies; that's food! The love from somebody pouring out their essence for another: that's food! The love coming from the long line of passed down traditions and hopes: that's food!" # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>You start to zone out from Bentley’s explanation and get the feeling that he is either an elitist about food and or has stretched his definition of ‘food’ to encompass everything. However when you zone back in, you recognize that Bentley is pointing a finger at you and is asking you a question.</i>

“I’m sorry, could you repeat that one more time to me?” 

<i>Bentley, without missing a beat while still pointing at you </i>“What is food?” # CLASS: Blobfish

*"Pineapple on pizza: that's food!" 

<i>The second after those words leave your mouth, you feel like you hear a record scratch come from Bentley. He slumps over a bit like he just took a punch to the gut before looking up at you with a look of what looks like genuine concern and pity.</i>

“Pineapple on pizza? That’s a crime” <i>he says defeatedly.</i> # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>You shrug sheepishly while looking back at him</i> “Can it be if it’s so good?”

<i>He lets out a sigh before stepping back to the pot and stirring once more.</i>
->blob_topics

*"Uhh.. Drooling because you forgot lunch; that’s food!"

<i>He takes as if to ponder your response then looks down before exclaiming with his fingers once again pointed towards the ceiling </i>“That’s food!” # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>After holding that pose for a good moment, Bentley relaxes and smiles at you</i>

“I’m so glad that we can be brothers-in-fins about food” he says before going back to stirring the pot. # CLASS: Blobfish

You verse jump back towards Bentley's apartment where you find him focusing on playing some JRPG on his console.

You call out meekly, “hey uh, Bentley?”

He doesn’t hear you through his headphones, his attention completely absorbed by being a sweaty tryhard gamer.

Seeing that this is going nowhere, you raise your voice, “Hey Bentley!?” 

Bentley pauses the game, pulls off his headphones, and looks at you. “What’s up?”

“Hey uh, are you busy? I just wanted to ask you something.”

“I’m just gaming right now, what is it?” Bentley asks. # CLASS: Blobfish

You squeeze out all the confidence you have in you for this one moment, you respond “hey uh, I was just thinking that I had a great time with you last time and I uh, was wondering if you would be interested in maybe going out with me?

For a few seconds, Bentley just stares at you blankly and after what feels like forever he replies:

    “Me? You wanna go out with me?” he asks you dumbfoundedly. “You aren’t trolling me are you?” Bentley looks at you with suspicion, but he seems to be shaken about this. # CLASS: Blobfish

“Why would I lie? I really felt a connection with you and would love to get to know you better.” 

Bentley slouches further into his gamer chair, hand covering his face as if he’s hiding, but you can still see a bit of redness in his cheeks. After a few seconds he looks at you through his fingers, and asks, “are you sure?” # CLASS: Blobfish

“Of course,” you reaffirm to him.

Bentley pauses for another few seconds, before finally muttering, “‘cause I was feeling the same way about you actually… No one seems to understand good quality content as much as you do. And… sorry for doubting your feelings, I just, guess I believed that maybe I would never get a date because I’m a ‘haha sweaty gamer,’ and when you came to me like this it seemed too good to be true.” # CLASS: Blobfish

“Oh it’s all good! I’m just glad that we feel the same way.” 

Bentley grabs an extra controller and hands it to you, “in that case then, you wanna fry some noobs with me?” # CLASS: Blobfish

“I dunno man, I’m just not really feeling the vibe between us, ya know? I feel like we should get to know each other better before we take that step.” # CLASS: Blobfish
“Oh, ok…” you respond, disappointed at being shot down.
They notice your expression and quickly move to ease your mind.
“But hey, I’m still down to game with you anytime! No reason why we can’t be friends.” # CLASS: Blobfish
A slight wave of relief washes over you. “Oh ok!” you repeat, this time less depressed. “I’ll see you later then.”
“Catch you at the next midnight launch?” they ask. # CLASS: Blobfish
“Definitely,” you smile, heading back from which you came.

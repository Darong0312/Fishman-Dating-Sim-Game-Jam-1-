<i>Taking hold of the controller, you close your eyes to blink and when you reopen them you find the walls apartment space filled with posters of various animes, video games, movies, and cartoons you know about but all of them appear to have the characters swapped opposite from what you know them as regularly except the Herring Otter Series posters.  But what really catches your attention is the absolutely savory smell wafting from the kitchen area of. </i>

<i>You follow the mouth-watering, heavenly scent you notice that this apartment's living area is a little more messier than yours with loads of memorabilia blankets and pillows of various characters in interesting clothing except for the table area which has a rather sizable TV, a laptop with glowing keys, and a few high end game consoles on it. Right next to it looms a giant clear case with what looks like little peop-?</i>

<i>You hear some loud popping and sizzling from the kitchen before you take a whiff an- wait *sniff* is tha- *sniff sniff* Oh, it's ramen *snif sniff sniifff* with the fried tempura vegetables!?  *sniff* AND THE SPICY HOTSAUCE!!</i>

<i>You burst into the kitchen where you find a young blobfish dude just a tad shorter than you, sprinkling some spices into pot from which the blessed aroma is originating from while faintly humming the opening song of 'My Eel Roe Acarpdemia'. Despite your rather sudden entrance, he doesn't notice you until you are basically drooling right next to him.</i>

"BwaAAAHH!" <i>he screams, while yanking out some earpods from his ears and jumping back from you.</i> # CLASS: Blobfish

"Who are you? Are you an intruder? Have you come to kill me? You can take my life but you will never take away my spirit or any of my limited edition memorabilia!" <i>he rapidly fires off while taking on a what you assume is some sort of fighting stance.</i> # CLASS: Blobfish

"N-no, I'm Gilbert your... neighbor I think" <i>you say while wiping the drool off of yourself and scatching your head.</i>

"Oh, okay then..." <i>the blobfish says as he drops his guard very slowly. Once he finishes, he looks at you and then slightly bows before saying </i>"I am Bentley. It's nice to meet you!"  # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>You pause for a second before bowing back, and once you do, Bentley goes back to stirring the pot like nothing happened.</i>

<i>Bentley looks over at you, and tilts his head as he asks</i> "Oh you're still here, what's up?" # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>Bentley laughs before smugly smiling, </i>"No, I am far from those who would relegate food to just a financial experience upon which nutrients are exchanged. I am among those who choose to enlighten the masses and spread the doctrine that food is more than what we treat it as." # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>Bentley steps away from the pot before striking a pose with one fist in the air </i>"Food is love! The love we show our own bodies; that's food! The love from somebody pouring out their essence for another: that's food! The love coming from the long line of passed down traditions and hopes: that's food!" # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>You start to zone out from Bentley’s explanation and get the feeling that he is either an elitist about food and or has stretched his definition of ‘food’ to encompass everything. However when you zone back in, you recognize that Bentley is pointing a finger at you and is asking you a question.</i>

“I’m sorry, could you repeat that one more time to me?” 

<i>Bentley, without missing a beat while still pointing at you </i>“What is food?” # CLASS: Blobfish

*"Pineapple on pizza: that's food!" 

    <i>The second after those words leave your mouth, you feel like you hear a record scratch come from Bentley. He slumps over a bit like he just took a punch to the gut before looking up at you with a look of what looks like genuine concern and pity.</i>
    
    “Pineapple on pizza? That’s a crime” <i>he says defeatedly.</i> # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    <i>You shrug sheepishly while looking back at him</i> “Can it be if it’s so good?”
    
    <i>He lets out a sigh before stepping back to the pot and stirring once more.</i>
    ->blob_topics

*"Uhh.. Drooling because you forgot lunch; that’s food!"

    <i>He takes as if to ponder your response then looks down before exclaiming with his fingers once again pointed towards the ceiling </i>“That’s food!” # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    <i>After holding that pose for a good moment, Bentley relaxes and smiles at you</i>
    
    “I’m so glad that we can be brothers-in-fins about food” <i>he says before going back to stirring the pot.</i> # CLASS: Blobfish

“I mean I would too if my setup in my apartment could handle it.” <i>you say and think to yourself</i> “also if I had more hours in a day I would.”

“I getcha on that, it took me a while to get my setup but movies are more than just how many pixels on a screen there are, or what green screen animations they can fit into the shot, you know?” <i>Bentley says while nodding his head up and down and stirring the pot at the same time.</i>  # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>He then begins to speed up both his nodding and stirring as says </i>“Sure you movie studios can highlight their technology, which is impressive when you look at it, but movies before didn’t have all that and they were still great. I mean it just goes to show how movies are just such a fantastic medium of storytelling!” and then stops as he reaches an eureka sort of position. # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>Bentley then looks back at you and says </i>“What do you mainly watch movies for?” # CLASS: Blobfish

You take a moment to consider all the movies you’ve ever watched and answer him back earnestly.
* “I like watching movies because the way story unfolds through both the action, the plot, and the visual storytelling”
    
    ~blob_aff ++

    “Exactly my point there!” He chimes cheerfully “Movies are just the best no matter what genre it is!” # CLASS: Blobfish

“Know about the series? I’m one of the moderators for the Findom boards and the Ottermore Community server” Bentley says, beaming with pride. 

You think back to your own experiences going to those boards and servers and shudder. 

You give a small salute to Bentley before saying “Thank you for your service.”

He laughs “Honestly it’s kinda fun especially with the amount of salt and shade some people throw in the discussion threads.” # CLASS: Blobfish

“Oh really?” you ask as hypothetical despite your own experiences you’ve had in the past.

“Yep, here let me ask you the debate of my favorite thread.” he says before getting all quiet and then asking in a comically serious manner “Which is better the books or the movies”? # CLASS: Blobfish

“Oh yeah! Especially since Jasmine joined it’s been really active! Lots of discourse on there. Gives me a lot to do in my free time. She really went off on this thread.” # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>He shows you the thread, where Jasmine is the most vocal person in there ranting about how the books are better than the movies. Bentley chuckles a bit as he wipes a tear away from his eyes “That was a fun weekend.” He then turns to you and asks in a comically serious manner </i>“Which is better, the books or the movies”? # CLASS: Blobfish

    “Right!? There’s so much work that goes into making a movie that people overlook just because it’s not as accurate. Just because it’s not accurate doesn’t mean that it’s not just as good!” <i>You nod along as he begins to rant about the positives and negatives of movie making. </i> # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    “I mean, Jasmine would disagree with me but that’s just because she’s a little bit of a snob about the fandom and a die hard for the books series but seriously who doesn’t like the movies??” # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    
    <i>You think back on all the theme parks and merchandise that’s available to you now that the franchise has become more widely known and made into movies. You start to wonder about the pros and cons of that, when Bentley beats you to it by bringing that up himself. The two of you talk about cinema and other nerdy things.</i>
    
    ->blob_topics
    
* I like the Books more because they do more justice to the story.

    Bentley sighs, “Man, not another one.” He shakes his head.  # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    “What do you mean?” You ask.
    
    “Don’t you love the artistry of cinema? The visuals of the world being brought to life?? The theme parks? The MERCHANDISE??” he asks. # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    You shrug noncommittally.
    
    He slouches, “Man… I guess everyone’s got their own tastes. It sucks that yours is bad though.” # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    You’re baffled but don’t protest, you don’t want to come off as rude to someone whose home you just appeared in. 
    ->blob_topics


=== blob_anime ==

“Yeah, I’m a bit of a connoisseur of anime.” he says, “It’s more of an art form than anything. An underappreciated one.” # CLASS: Blobfish

You glance at one of the other posters on the wall of a scantily clad frogfish. Their cheeks are covered with pink circles. It’s not an amazing poster. But everyone has their own tastes you suppose.  

“What’s your favorite?” you ask.

Without hesitation, Bentley answers, “My Eel Roe Acarpdemia. The story is great, and so is the animation. I actually have several figurines of the characters. But someone that I know who is also a swordfish doesn’t appreciate the same characters as me.” he gestures to a glass box resting on top of a bookcase filled with manga. The box is filled with different brightly colored characters in different action p oses. 

* “Oh cool, is that Carp Man? The best hero in the show?”
    
    ~sword_facts += figurine_known
    ~blob_aff ++
    
    Bentley smiles, “Yeah! I got him at a convention. It was the last one at the stall, they sell out pretty fast, and this one is a rare pose, too!” he replies, “The stall owner liked my cosplay and gave me a discount! And later I got to meet the original voice actor! It was such a great day.” # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    “That must have been really fun!” You say.
    
    Bentley nods vigorously, “Oh yea! It was great. Except Spencer took the last Squid Girl figurine… I had been looking for that for a long-bass time. He didn’t even know that it was collectable! He just thought that it was neat looking! I mean, he liked the character but he couldn’t even answer any trivia about the character. He didn’t even know about her super secret backstory that you could only get by going to the website and watching the director’s cut of the show! What a poser.” # CLASS: Blobfish
     
    As Bentley continues to talk about different conventions and such, you notice that the ramen is boiling over and point to the pot behind him. Bentley reacts quickly to it by lowering the heat and stirring before giving an awkward laugh.
    
    ->blob_topics

    
 * “Ew is that Carp Man? I hate that guy, he's a jerk!”
 
    ~blob_aff --
    
    Bentley deflates a little bit, and turns back to what he was doing. He sighs and shakes his head, “Damn, another tasteless member of the masses. I thought you were different.” he says, “Carp Man only acts the way he does because his wife, who was allergic to eggs, died in a horrible mayonnaise accident, along with his whole soccer team. His parents also died before he was born. He’s morally complex and moody, a lot cooler than the other happy-go-lucky characters that never lose and are always nice to people. He’s deep. He’s real life.” # CLASS: Blobfish
    
    He goes back to stirring the pot, this time his shoulders are slumping.

===blob_back===
You start to ask him another question when you begin to feel yourself fade away into your own universe. As you flicker, Bentley looks over at you with a mix of confusion and mild concern before you completely disappear. You guess that your time of talking about nerdy things is done.

<i>You verse jump back towards Bentley's apartment where you find him focusing on playing some JRPG on his console.

You call out meekly, </i>“hey uh, Bentley?”

<i>He doesn’t hear you through his headphones, his attention completely absorbed by being a sweaty tryhard gamer.

Seeing that this is going nowhere, you raise your voice, </i>“Hey Bentley!?” 

<i>Bentley pauses the game, pulls off his headphones, and looks at you. </i>“What’s up?”

“Hey uh, are you busy? I just wanted to ask you something.”

“I’m just gaming right now, what is it?” Bentley asks. # CLASS: Blobfish

<i>You squeeze out all the confidence you have in you for this one moment, you respond </i>“hey uh, I was just thinking that I had a great time with you last time and I uh, was wondering if you would be interested in maybe going out with me?

<i>For a few seconds, Bentley just stares at you blankly and after what feels like forever he replies:</i>

{ 
- blob_aff >= 2:
    “Me? You wanna go out with me?” he asks you dumbfoundedly. “You aren’t trolling me are you?” Bentley looks at you with suspicion, but he seems to be shaken about this. # CLASS: Blobfish

“Why would I lie? I really felt a connection with you and would love to get to know you better.” 

<i>Bentley slouches further into his gamer chair, hand covering his face as if he’s hiding, but you can still see a bit of redness in his cheeks. After a few seconds he looks at you through his fingers, and asks, </i>“are you sure?” # CLASS: Blobfish

“Of course,” <i>you reaffirm to him.</i>

<i>Bentley pauses for another few seconds, before finally muttering, </i>“‘cause I was feeling the same way about you actually… No one seems to understand good quality content as much as you do. And… sorry for doubting your feelings, I just, guess I believed that maybe I would never get a date because I’m a ‘haha sweaty gamer,’ and when you came to me like this it seemed too good to be true.” # CLASS: Blobfish

“Oh it’s all good! I’m just glad that we feel the same way.”

“Oh, ok…” <i>you respond, disappointed at being shot down.</i>
<i>They notice your expression and quickly move to ease your mind.</i>
“But hey, I’m still down to game with you anytime! No reason why we can’t be friends.” # CLASS: Blobfish
<i>A slight wave of relief washes over you. “Oh ok!” you repeat, this time less depressed. </i>“I’ll see you later then.”
“Catch you at the next midnight launch?” they ask. # CLASS: Blobfish
“Definitely,” <i>you smile, heading back from which you came.</i>

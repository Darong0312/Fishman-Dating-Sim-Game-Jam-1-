You verse jump back towards Jasmine's apartment where you find her quickly typing at her computer with small fits of giggling breaking up her rhythym but she doesn't seem to notice you.

You take a step forward and trip on a power cable stretched across the floor, stumbling loudly. She spins around in her chair, startled, and gasps excitedly.

"Hey!" she smiles. "I was just telling my friends about you! What are you doing here?"

Your heart skips a beat as you shyly work up the courage to ask her.

"I actually wanted to ask you something. Do you wanna go out with me?"
